<p> <span className="heading">A quantum chemical studies on antioxidant activity of benzimidazole</span>
This study uses computer-based physics and quantum chemistry to see how well benzimidazole can
fight harmful molecules called free radicals. By doing calculations, it helps understand how the
molecule behaves, how stable it is, and how good it is as an antioxidant — without doing real lab
experiments.</p>
